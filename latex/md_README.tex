When it was recommended that I partake in the Purdue University Post Graduate program in Data Science, (with it\textquotesingle{}s focus on Machine Learning and AI), a curiosity developed concerning the ability of a mere Linear\+Regression model and the ability to predict Gary Kasparov\textquotesingle{}s next move. This curiosity grew into this project. $>$G\+I\+V\+EN that advanced AI software platforms have already been developed for Chess games $>$W\+H\+EN experimentation on Machine Learning and AI with respect to Chess logic gets the better of me \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{$>$\+T\+H\+E\+N we add popular methods explored in the field of Machine Learning and A\+I with this C++/\+Python open source package.}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
